    <h1>Five Rules pertaining to Apostrophes</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Plurals</h4>
        Never use apostrophes in plurals
        <ul>
          <li>Cameras, <b>not</b> Camera's</li>
          <li>DVDs, <b>not</b> DVD's</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Contraction</h4>
        Apostrophes also signify contraction of two words into one, this is mostly used in informal writing
        <ul>
          <li>"You are" can be written "You're" (Note that "your" is different, it is possessive; see rule 3)</li>
          <li>"They are" can be written "They're"</li>
          <li>"It is" can be written "It's"</li>
          <li>"Who is" can be written "Who's" (Note that "whose" is different)</li>
          <li>"Can not" can be written "Can't" (Note that "can not" as two words is rarely used when the single word "cannot" exists)</li>
          <li>"She would have" can be written "She'd've"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Possession</h4>
        Apostrophes signify possesion
        <ul>
          <li>Adam's DVDs</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Note1: "your" signifies possession by "you". e.g. Your DVDs<br/>
        Note2: "whose" is a request for possession: who owns it? e.g. Whose book is this?<br/>
        Note3: "whose" is also a relative pronoun, e.g. James is someone whose opinion I value
      </li>
      <li><h4>Possessive form of It</h4>
        Because "it's" means "it is" we use no apostrophe to signify possession in the case of "it"
        <ul>
          <li>Its premise (the premise of It), <b>not</b> It's premise (It is premise)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Remove double-"S" (optional)</h4>
        Where an apostrophe is used and results in "s's" this can be shortened to "s'"
        <ul>
          <li>"James's house" can be written "James' house"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
